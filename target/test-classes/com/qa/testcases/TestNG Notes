1) TestNG- Next generation - Its Unit test Framework
Its is also called TDD-Test Driver development 

2) purpose: Design test cases in a Systematic  way
--Generate HTML Report 
--Different Annotations  
--Define test cases depend on Priority/Sequence
--Dependency feature 
--Grouping 
--Data Provider
 
3) Its a Open source i.e free  and its available in the form of JAR file
4) Its only application only JAVA

5) Install testNG in eclipse
 
6) You can divide TestNg into 3 different Annotations like

I) Pre-Condition  
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod  - It will execute before every @Test Annotations

II) Test condition
@Test          -It will execute every @Test Annotations

III) Post-Condition
@AfterMethod  --It will execute After every @Test Annotations
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite

7)We can ran the test case depending on priority like which test case we need to 1st or last as respective.
@Test (priority=1) Note: priority is Keyword 
8)We can also ran test cases depending and Groups like we have 100 test cases and I have to run 20  "Search_page" test cases so can define group 
Some  20 test cases related to "Regression" and so on we can create a group such scenario  
@Test (priority=1,groups="Regression" )  Note: groups is Keyword 

8)dependsOnMethods - we have have some dependency on some test case then we can have dependsOnMethods
